# This is a ✨cheat sheet✨ for using terminal, git, github and markdown.

## Terminal
- Open terminal using cmd+spacebar and search terminal.
- The main bits and bobs have already been installed, so lets get straight into the commands:

| Command name | What it does |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|`pwd` | Tells you what file you're currently in the the file pathway|
|`ls` | Gives you a list of all the folders (in blue) and files (in white) of the directo*ry you're currently in |
|`la -a` | `-a` acts as a 'flag' to the `ls` command and gives you a list of ALL folders and files, **including hidden ones**|
|`ls -l` | `-l` acts as a 'flag' to the `ls` command and gives you information on the files and folders|
|`ls -al`|Can combine flags to give multiple results: `-al` gives results of both `-a` and `-l`|
|`cd [directory name]`|Allows you to change the directory you're 'in'|
|`cd` | On its own, `cd` takes you directly back to the home directory |
|`.`|Current directory|
|`..`|Parent directory (the 'above' folder that the file/folder is in)|
|`mkdir [directory name]`|Makes a directory|
|`touch [file name]`|Creates a file|
|`open`|Opens a file|
|`code .`|Opens a file in VScode|
|`mv [file/folder name] [directory name]`|This moves the directory that is named into the directory that is named (can also use `..` for directory name, to move to parent directory)|
|`mv [file name] [new file name]`| Can also use the move command to rename a file. The [new file name] overrides the [file name]|
|`rm [file/folder]`|Delete command. **Does NOT send to bin, it is permanently deleted.**  |
|`rm -r`|`-r` is another 'flag' that deletes everything in the directory|
|`rm -rf`|Basically deletes everything in its path with no care for consequences. **DO NOT USE**|
|`history`|Command to show you all your previous commands|



- notes, tips and tricks:
    1. Creating a txt file is `.txt` at end of file name
    2. Creating a markdown file is `.md` at end of file name
    3. **no white spaces in file names**
    4. Clicking ↑ arrow on keyboard shows previous command. Continue clicking to go further back. Can click ↓ to move foward again to the command wanted.
    5. Pressing command+l gives white space between lines.
