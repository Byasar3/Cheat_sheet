# This is a cheat sheet for using terminal, git, github and markdown.

## Terminal
- Open terminal using cmd+spacebar and search terminal.
- The main bits and bobs have already been installed, so lets get straight into the commands.

| Command name | What it does |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|`pwd` | Tells you what file you're currently in the the file pathway|
|`ls` | Give you a list of all the folders (in blue) and files (in white) of the directory you're currently in |
|`la -a` | `-a` acts as a 'flag' to the `ls` command and gives you a list of ALL folders and files, including hidden ones|
|`ls -l` | `-l` acts as a 'flag' to the `ls` command and gives you information on the files and folders|
|`ls -al`|can combine flags to give multiple results: `-al` gives results of both `-a` and `-l`|
|`cd [directory name]`|allows you to change directory|
|`cd` | On its own, `cd` takes you directly back to the home directory |
|`.`|current directory|
|`..`|parent directory (the 'above' folder that the file/folder is in)|
|`mkdir [directory name]`| makes a directory|
|`touch [file name]`|creates a file|
|`open`| opens a file|
|`code .`|opens a file in VScode|


- notes:
    1. Creating a txt file is `.txt` at end of file name
    2. Creating a markdown file is `.md` at end of file name
    3. **no white spaces in file names**
